# When obtaining a certificate from a certificate authority (CA), the usual flow is:
# In our case safaricom

# 1.You generate a private/public key pair.
# 2.You create a request for a certificate, which is signed by your key (to prove that you own that key).
# 3.You give your CSR to a CA (but not the private key).
# 4.The CA validates that you own the resource (e.g. domain) you want a certificate for.
# 5.The CA gives you a certificate, signed by them, which identifies your public key, and the resource you are authenticated for.
# 6.You configure your server to use that certificate, combined with your
# private key, to server traffic.
